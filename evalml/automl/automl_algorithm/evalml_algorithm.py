    1. Naive pipelines:
        a. run baseline with default preprocessing pipeline
        b. run naive linear model with default preprocessing pipeline
        c. run basic RF pipeline (for feature selection) with default preprocessing pipeline
    2. Feature engineering and naive pipelines with feature selection:
        a. create feature selection component with previous batchesâ€™ RF estimator then add to another linear model
        b. Run feature engineering: leveraging featuretools and our DFSTransformer
    3. Naive pipelines with feature engineering
        a. Use FT component from previous batch with naive linear model and RF pipeline
    4. Naive pipelines with feature engineering and feature selection
        a. use previous RF estimator to run FS with naive linear model

    At this point we have a single pipeline candidate for preprocessing, feature engineering and feature selection

    5. Pipelines with preprocessing components:
        a. scan estimators (our current batch 1).
        b. Then run ensembling

    Fast mode ends here. Begin long mode.

    6. Run some random pipelines:
        a. Choose top 3 estimators. Generate 50 random parameter sets. Run all 150 in one batch
    7. Run ensembling
    8. Repeat these indefinitely until stopping criterion is met:
        a. For each of the previous top 3 estimators, sample 10 parameters from the tuner. Run all 30 in one batch
        b. Run ensembling

    Jeremy notes:
        Do we need to allow users to select what models and pipelines are allowed?
            - originally my thinking was we would remove that choice from user
            - however, how does the automl_search impl affect it?
        
        options:
            - top level user can select and pass down
            - do not let users select
        
        considerations
            - change `AutoMLAlgorithm` init impl to not create tuners for each pipeline?
            - ignore `AutoMLAlgorithm` init and do our own thing here
